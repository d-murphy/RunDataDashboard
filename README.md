# RunDataDashboard

[View the Project](https://d-murphy.github.io/StravaRunDataDashboard.html)

This page uses the D3 library to visualize running data exported from the Strava run tracking app.  

The project was completed during my 2nd week at the Recurse Center. My learning objectives included:

* Clean and wrangle an external data source
* Explore different chart type implementations with D3
* Utilize a CSS grid layout
